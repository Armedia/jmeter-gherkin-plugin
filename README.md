# Armedia ArkCase JMeter Selenium Helpers

This package contains a set of utility classes that will facilitate the construction of tests and automation scripts for use with ArkCase, executed using JMeter's Selenium WebDriver Sampler.  The classes contained herein are meant to provide shorthand functionality that can be leveraged to write terse, easy-to-understand automation code similar to the code used in the Protractor UI tests.
